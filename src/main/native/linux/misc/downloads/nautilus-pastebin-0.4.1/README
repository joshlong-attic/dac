What is this?
--------------------
nautilus-pastebin is an extension for the GNOME file manager, which allows
users to send files to pastebins just a right-click away.

How does it work?
--------------------
Simply: right-click on a file, select «Pastebin» and, if the Internet
connection is active, after few seconds the application will show a
notification and copy the paste URL to your clipboard, allowing you to paste
it in a browser tab, IRC channel or wherever you want.

Where can I download it? And how can install it?
--------------------
After uncompressing this tarball, you can:

 1) Use the setup.py script.
 2) Copy:
     scripts/nautilus-pastebin.py to /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python/
     data/nautilus-pastebin.png to /usr/share/pixmaps/


After the installation, you may need to restart Nautilus by typing:

killall nautilus

At the moment, some pastebins of the preconfigured ones don’t work well and I
need some time to improve and extend the support for other websites.

If you wanted to contribute to the development by sending me patches,
configurations or suggestions I would be very happy!
